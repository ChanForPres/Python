<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>HTML has had a life-span of roughly seven years. During that
time, it has evolved from a simple language with a small number of
tags to a complex system of mark-up, enabling authors to create
all-singing-and-dancing Web pages complete with animated images,
sound and all manner of gimmicks. This chapter tells you something
about the Web's early days, HTML, and about the people, companies
and organizations who contributed to HTML+, HTML 2, HTML 3.2
and finally, HTML 4.</table>


<p>This chapter is a short history of HTML. Its aim is to give
readers some idea of how the HTML we use today was developed from
the prototype written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1992. The story is
interesting - not least because HTML has been through an
extremely bumpy ride on the road to standardization, with software
engineers, academics and browser companies haggling about the
language like so many Ministers of Parliament debating in the House
of Commons.

<h3>1989: Tim Berners-Lee invents the Web with HTML as its
publishing language</h3>

<p>The World Wide Web began life in the place where you would least
expect it: at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in
Geneva, Switzerland. CERN is a meeting place for physicists from all
over the world, where highly abstract and conceptual thinkers engage
in the contemplation of complex atomic phenomena that occur on a
minuscule scale in time and space. This is a surprising place indeed
for the beginnings of a technology which would, eventually, deliver
everything from tourist information, online shopping and
advertisements, financial data, weather forecasts and much more to
your personal computer.

<p>Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the Web. In 1989, Tim was
working in a computing services section of CERN when he came up with
the concept; at the time he had no idea that it would be implemented
on such an enormous scale. Particle physics research often involves
collaboration among institutes from all over the world. Tim had the
idea of enabling researchers from remote sites in the world to
organize and pool together information. But far from simply making
available a large number of research documents as files that could
be downloaded to individual computers, he suggested that you could
actually link the text in the files themselves. 

<p>In other words, there could be cross-references from one research
paper to another. This would mean that while reading one research
paper, you could quickly display part of another paper that holds
directly relevant text or diagrams. Documentation of a scientific
and mathematical nature would thus be represented as a `web' of
information held in electronic form on computers across the world.
This, Tim thought, could be done by using some form of hypertext,
some way of linking documents together by using buttons on the
screen, which you simply clicked on to jump from one paper to
another. Before coming to CERN, Tim had already worked on document
production and text processing, and had developed his first
hypertext system, `Enquire', in 1980 for his own personal use.

<p>Tim's prototype Web browser on the NeXT computer came out in 1990.

<h3>Through 1990: The time was ripe for Tim's invention</h3>

<p>The fact that the Web was invented in the early 1990s was no
coincidence. Developments in communications technology during that
time meant that, sooner or later, something like the Web was bound
to happen. For a start, <em>hypertext</em> was coming into vogue and
being used on computers. Also, Internet u
